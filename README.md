Acoustic Room Impulse Response (RIR) generator using the (Randomized) Image Method for rectangular rooms. Convolving a RIR with an audio file adds reverberation.

## Installation

To install the package, hit `]` from the Julia command line to enter the package manager, then

```julia
pkg> add ImageMethodReverb
```

See the demo folder for some examples.

Type `?rim` for more details. By default the randomized image method from [1] is used. The original image method proposed in [2] can be reproduced as well by turning off the randomization and fractional delays.

## Other languages implementations

A MATLAB implementation of the Randomized Image Method can be found [here](https://github.com/enzodesena/rim).
